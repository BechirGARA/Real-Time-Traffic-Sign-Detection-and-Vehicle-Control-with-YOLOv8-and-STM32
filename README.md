# Real-Time-Traffic-Sign-Detection-and-Vehicle-Control-with-YOLOv8-and-STM32
This project integrates advanced AI and embedded systems to achieve real-time traffic sign detection and vehicle control. It employs a YOLOv8 model for detecting traffic signs (e.g., stop panels, red signals, and green signals) and utilizes an STM32 microcontroller for vehicle control through serial communication.
